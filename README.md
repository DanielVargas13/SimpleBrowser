Because it uses the engine of Internet Explorer, it is vulnerable to the
browser crashers (JavaScript infinite alert etc.). If you were unable to
close it, please restart the PC or kill the process on Task Manager. 
If you still couldn't close it, please press and hold the power button
as a last resort.
